## Mobiz Test Task

Due to lack of time, I could only integrate the Tables UI available on the /products page. Libraries used:
- ShadCN UI with RadixUI, for reusable components styled with TailwindCSS.
- React Hook form with Zod, for handling forms and validations.
- React Query, for state management and caching.
- Axios, for fetching data from dummyjson API.
- Lucide react for icons.
- Cookies-next to store cookies for bearer token and user data.
- UitoDev for debounce hook to delay api calls when searching.
